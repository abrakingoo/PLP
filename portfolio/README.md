## 🔧 Development Process

Although this is a solo project, here's an overview of how I approached the development:

- ✅ **HTML & CSS**: lightweight, fast-loading, and fully static portfolio without relying on JavaScript or frameworks — perfect for learning and accessibility.
- ✅ **Responsive Design**: built mobile-first using CSS Grid and Flexbox to ensure the layout works across all screen sizes.
- ✅ **Version Control**: Git was used consistently to track changes and manage the project in a structured way. Commit history reflects the step-by-step build process.
- ✅ **Tools Used**:
  - Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
  - Formspree (for handling contact form submissions)
  - Vercel (for deploying the live site)
  - Live Server extension (for local preview during development)
